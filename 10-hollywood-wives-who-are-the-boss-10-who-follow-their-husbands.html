Couples can be either submissive or dominant. If a couple understands each other, they will live happily ever after, regardless of anything else. We have studied and found some couples who have a dominant wife or a husband. Generally,&nbsp;celeb wives dominate at home, but there are exceptional cases of a careerist woman who wants her husband to be the boss of the house and also direct their lives. There is nothing more pleasurable than when your man who cares for you can decide on your life, at least for those women. Other celebs feel differently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whatever it is, the ultimate motto is to have a peaceful life. There is usually only one person who has all the authority so that it does not create confusion. So, we have studied and found twenty couples&nbsp;where the husbands are the bosses and others where the wives dominate the scenario. It’s interesting to know that there are pros and cons of both sides. But how they manage and what is their formula to a peaceful life is interesting.</p><p>Couples definitely have their own way of navigating their lives, separately and together, but it is still interesting to see what it is that they do to have a healthy and happy home life.</p><h2 id=boss---amal-doesn-t-like-separation>BOSS - AMAL DOESN'T LIKE SEPARATION</h2><p>When George and Amal got married, the world was shocked. For a long time, George remained a playboy, so to see him settle down with the right person was mindblowing. While Martha Stewart Weddings was interviewing George, George said that he feels more humble now that he has settled down, even though it took a long time. He's just happy he found his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that he has found himself his longtime partner, he has no problem giving himself completely to her. All Amal wants is that George should stay with her and give her some quality time. They have a home in London, and George prefers to stay there and do all film-related jobs like writing scripts, deciding on productions and more. Amal wants him around constantly, and so that's just how it has to be.</p><p>This Hollywood wife sets strict rules to her man, and she makes sure he follows them. George himself is probably so in love that the whole thing doesn't matter to him. He is likely just happy to be with someone for the long run, after all this time.</p><h2 id=follow-their-husbands---meghan-markle-follows-royal-protocols>follow their husbands - MEGHAN MARKLE FOLLOWS ROYAL PROTOCOLS</h2><p>The&nbsp;biggest marriage of 2018 will be Meghan and Prince Harry’s, no matter who gets married after them. She is a new&nbsp;member of the Royal family and needs the Queen’s blessings for her new life, but she has to sacrifice a lot for it.
