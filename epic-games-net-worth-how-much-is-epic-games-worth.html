Over the years, the company transformed, rebranding as Epic MegaGames and finally becoming Epic Games.</p><p>Under Tim Sweeney’s visionary leadership, Epic Games achieved significant milestones that propelled the company forward. One of the most notable accomplishments was the creation of the Unreal Engine in 1995.
