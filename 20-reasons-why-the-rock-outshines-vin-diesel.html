He’s one of the top leading action heroes today. He brings an intensity, charm and unique sense of humor to all his film roles. Other action heroes might feel a bit intimidated by somebody with his massive size and charisma. CGI couldn’t create an action hero this perfect. Johnson has starred in several popular action films and franchises. For years, fans wondered what would happen if The Rock and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Vin Diesel</a> ever crossed paths. They both star in the hugely popular Fast and the Furious franchise. They’ve butted heads in the past and don’t always get along. Diesel has a presence all his own but its overshadowed by The Rock’s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson casts a large shadow and often steals the show. Not even someone like Vin Diesel can get noticed. The two action heroes had a public feud that has fans discussing a dream match. The two stars continue to work together for the best of the films&nbsp;but the underlying tension still exists. Regardless, The Rock always outshines Diesel in every category. From his freakish physique to his undeniable charisma Rock is in a league all his own. Here is a look at 20 Reasons The Rock Outshines Vin Diesel.</p><h2 id=the-rock-s-physique><strong>The Rock’s Physique</strong></h2><p>Vin Diesel is best known for his role as Dominic Toretto in the Fast and the Furious franchise. The first film was released in 2001 and Diesel has starred in the majority of them. 8 films have been released with the ninth on its way and the tenth expected to be the final film. Dwayne Johnson made his first appearance in the 2011 film Fast Five. He portrays DSS agent Luke Hobbs and is initially in pursuit of Toretto. Johnson was so impressive in the franchise that he has received his very own spinoff. Fans had waited a long time to see the massive stars face off and&nbsp;they didn't disappoint audiences. They're both in incredible physical shape but Johnson is slightly bigger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be fair, Diesel is no slouch; it’s just that the Rock is a freak. They both have incredible physiques and both put in a great deal of work at the gym. The Rock stands at an impressive 6 feet 5 inches while Diesel is a solid 6 feet. Johnson also has slightly larger biceps as his are 20 inches while Diesel’s are 18 inches. Diesel is in exceptional shape but The Rock is on a whole different level.</p><h2 id=the-rock-s-workout><strong>The Rock’s Workout&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The Rock is known for his impressive physique and giant muscles. His body and look certainly helps him land all these action hero roles. However,&nbsp;Johnson puts in a great deal of work into his body and health. If he’s not on set, he’s at the gym or squeezing in a workout at the hotel. He said, “Working out is my therapy, and it's cheaper than a shrink.” He wakes up each morning at 3:30 am and hits the road for his morning run at 4 am.

Anyone that ever wants to challenge Johnson must also be in phenomenal shape. Vin Diesel certainly has a great physique but might want to reconsider feuding with The Rock.</p><p>In 2016, Johnson sent out a message on Instagram that many interpreted as a shot at Diesel.</p><p><strong>He wrote, “Some [male co-stars] conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't.

It was later revealed that the tension was so intense that their scenes were shot separately. They have since had a meeting where they attempted to clear the air. Johnson said, “And what I came to realize is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating." According to Johnson, they now have clarity between them. Diesel said, “It's not always easy being an alpha and it's two alphas.

This was clearly a blessing in disguise. Eventually, Diesel ended up falling in love with acting.</p><p>However, The Rock has been successful in several different mediums. Before his days in the WWE and Hollywood, Rock had plans to play in the NFL. He won a national championship as a member of the 1991 Miami Hurricanes. He had aspirations to compete in the NFL but was sidelined with numerous injuries. He then briefly played in the Canadian Football League as a member of the Calgary Stampeders but was eventually cut. He said, “The dreams I had, they’re dashed. There is no more football. My relationship was crushed. That was my absolute worst time.” However, Rock would display the very attributes that have helped turn him into a major star. He refused to give up and found a new path in life.

He starred in several popular films, such as Walking Tall, Be Cool and Gridiron Gang.</p><p>Johnson doesn’t just workout six days a week in the gym but he also has a strict diet he sticks to.

One of his favorite cheat meals is 8 slices of sourdough French toast topped with loads of apple pie.

He is also a director of The Beacon Experience, which aims to encourage children to continue their education after high school.

While Diesel does encourage his followers, he doesn’t post videos like the Rock does. To be fair, few celebs workout as intensely and post their workouts for their followers. Johnson loves to workout and shares it with his millions and millions of fans. He said, “I get busy with a nice session of clangin’ and bangin’—epic pain, epic results. I'm big on ‘together we conquer’ and ‘train to progress,’ so I like to share that on social media.

Johnson joined fans on the red carpet and took 105 selfies in three minutes. He entered the prestigious record books for this feat. The organization confirmed that Johnson’s selfies met the requirements necessary to break the record.

Back then, he was still The Rock, just taking baby steps out of the WWE ring.

The film is tentatively titled Hobbs & Shaw and is due out in 2019. The studio decided to push back the release of Fast and Furious 9 to 2020. This made some of Johnson’s co-stars a bit unhappy.&nbsp;The tension between Johnson and Vin Diesel got a little more intense but now includes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyrese Gibson</a>. Gibson portrays Roman Pearce in the franchise.

Rock is known for getting along well with his co-stars and the crew. On the other hand, Diesel can be a bit difficult to work with. During the filming of Fast & Furious 7, Diesel rubbed some of his co-stars and crew members the wrong way. He pushed his start time to 10 am since he didn’t like waking up for 7 am start times. One source noted, “Vin spent a whole day in his trailer one day. The next day, they waited four hours for him. He called a meeting of studio execs to his trailer for two-and-a-half hours to say, ‘what the (expletive) am I doing here?’” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IBTimes</a>) He apparently criticized his co-stars performances as well and stressed out the crew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Johnson’s colleagues on set often praise him.
