These wrestlers know that the chances of becoming a champion within the organization are slim, but some actually make it all of the way, achieving a seemingly impossible dream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, getting there is just the first step. Staying relevant in the ever-changing world of professional wrestling, avoiding long-term injuries that can kill a career, and maintaining a high level of success&nbsp;can be just as challenging as breaking into the business.</p><p>Champs with longevity like <a href=#>John Cena</a>, <a href=#>Sting</a>, and <a href=#>Triple H</a> are rare in this industry, and most champions come and go within just a few years. Unfortunately, once they leave the organization, some have made some poor decisions that have sent them into a spiral to hit rock bottom.</p><p>From becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol after their reign in professional wrestling to being irresponsible with money, there are several former WWE stars who didn’t fare well after their final bell. Here, we have a list of 20 wrestlers that hit rock bottom after leaving the WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-virgil-becomes-lonely-after-his-wwe-stint><strong>20. Virgil Becomes Lonely After His WWE Stint</strong></h2><p>Not all wrestlers who hit rock bottom simply give in to addictions or go to jail. In the 1990s, a man by the name of Michael Jones was a wrestler who went by the name of Virgil and was the personal assistant to Ted DiBiase. His career in the WWE was fairly short-lived, however, and even during his stint with the organization, he never came close to winning a championship. After his run in the professional wrestling industry, Virgil began attending comic book conventions to peddle trading cards, photos, and autographs. Unfortunately, photos posted online show that not many fans were interested in purchasing his wares. Virgil has also been spotted at flea markets and boardwalks trying to peddle his autographed merchandise.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=19-hbk-bottoms-out-then-bounces-back><strong>19. HBK Bottoms Out, Then Bounces Back</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Shawn Michaels</a>, known as The Heartbreak Kid, had a reputation in the WWE for being a hard partier, particularly when he was partnered with Marty Janetty. The duo became troublemakers and had a lot of negative attention, and after a barroom fight, both were fired from the WWE. After he got fired, Michaels turned to drugs and alcohol and became an addict. However, he decided that he wanted to continue pursuing his dream, and no longer known as the troublemaker, The Heartbreak Kid was born. These days, Michaels still makes WWE appearances, although a bad back prevents him from competing. He is also a born-again Christian.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-tyson-tomko-throws-away-his-career><strong>18. Tyson Tomko Throws Away His Career</strong></h2><p>Tyson Tomko may only be known to the most hardcore WWE fans, but he was a staple on TNA wrestling and was once slated to be a big deal within the organization. After his character fell flat in TNA, Tomko signed a contract with WWE. However, he never made any appearances on WWE’s shows. He returned to TNA, but fans noticed he was different. The difference was that Tomko was addicted to opiates, and his addiction was so bad, he robbed a pharmacy and was arrested while shooting up drugs in the bathroom of a Chili’s restaurant. Tomko went into rehab and has been cleaning up his life. However, at this point in his life, it is unlikely that he will be able to return to his wrestling career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=17-the-british-bulldog-had-troubles-in-and-out-of-the-ring><strong>17. The British Bulldog Had Troubles In and Out of the Ring</strong></h2><p>Davey Boy Smith, known by his ring name of British Bulldog, was a tough contender in the WWE ring. Unfortunately, many wrestlers who want to gain the upper hand in the industry turn to steroids, and Smith was no exception. Smith had feuds in and out of the ring, but his biggest problem was the use of drugs and steroids. He was even sent to rehab by the WWE for his abuse of these things. In 2002, at the age of 39, Smith had a heart attack that claimed his life. It was found that the use of steroids, painkillers, and the serious injuries he had incurred over the years were factors in his death.</p><p></p><h2 id=16-miss-elizabeth-loses-her-battle-with-addictions><strong>16.

Known as Mr. Perfect in the ring, he was the perfect combination of charisma, charm, arrogance, and talent. However, his behavior outside of the ring ultimately led to his untimely death. It all began when he got into an altercation with <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> on an airplane after getting drunk. This act disgraced the WWE, who removed Hennig from the roster in 2003. Just one year later, he was found dead in a hotel room. The cause of death was an overdose on cocaine.

Bagwell now moonlights as a paid gigolo, earning up to $25,000 for spending time with a lady for one full week. In interviews, Bagwell has said that he is very successful at&nbsp;what he does, so many may question whether or not he truly hit rock bottom. However, this is a very different career from being a professional wrestler, and many question just how successful he is. Bagwell is married, but apparently has an open marriage with his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-x-pac-got-high-before-stepping-into-the-ring><strong>13.

Sadly, Miss Elizabeth overdosed in Luger’s home at a later time. A string of felony charges led to Luger’s arrest and 3-month imprisonment, along with five years of probation.
