The catch is that people who collect and obsess over coins and other types of currency, or numismatists as they prefer to be called, are extremely particular about the quality and appearance of the tiny pieces of money they hold so dear. An entire system of grading exists to determine the quality of an individual coin, ranging from 1 all the way to 70, and the difference in a single point can be worth tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>It should go without saying that coins worth six or seven figures are exceedingly rare, and just how hard it is to find them can play a huge role in the price tag they receive. It also takes quite some time before a coin becomes valuable, so unfortunately, the odds of a person unknowingly having a valuable piece in their piggy banks are virtually nonexistent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Generally speaking, the only way to attain such a pricey piece of metal is through auctions, and with every hungry collector constantly checking the circuit for the prettiest and rarest coins around means simply being in attendance at the right time is in no way a guarantee to walk out of there with the big prize.
