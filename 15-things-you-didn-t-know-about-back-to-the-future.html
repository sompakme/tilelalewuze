Where we’re going we don’t need roads". The Back to the Future trilogy revolved around teenager Marty McFly and scientist Dr. Emmett Brown, living in 1985 as they travel through time visiting 1955, 2015, an alternative 1985 and 1885. The trilogy is very popular but it was the first film that was a massive success. The first film in the trilogy became one of the highest grossing films of 1985 and went on to become an international sensation. <a href=#>Robert Zemeckis</a> and <a href=#>Bob Gale</a> co-wrote the trilogy and Zemeckis directed all three films, which starred <a href=#>Michael J. Fox</a>, <a href=#>Christopher Lloyd</a>, <a href=#>Lea Thompson</a> and <a href=#>Thomas F. Wilson</a>. The trilogy includes Back to the Future (July 3, 1985), Back to the Future Part II (November 22, 1989) and Back to the Future Part III (May 25, 1990). The first film in the trilogy, Back to the Future, won several awards including an Academy Award, Hugo Award and a Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. The Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2007. The success of the trilogy led to several spin-offs including the animated series Back to the Future, a long line of video games and a Back to the Future musical. It also included a motion-simulated ride at Universal Studios that has since been closed down. The film had such a huge impact that former President&nbsp;<a href=#>Ronald Regan</a> even quoted the film during his 1986 State of The Union Address.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The trilogy remains popular to this day and has some of the most loyal fans. The film is full of Easter eggs, secrets and behind the scenes happenings that fans might not be aware of. Some fans might even be surprised by some secrets they might not even know. Here is a look at 15 Things You Didn’t Know About The Back to the Future Trilogy.</p><h2 id=twin-pines-mall-becomes-lone-pine-mall>15. Twin Pines Mall Becomes Lone Pine Mall</h2><p>pintjockeyonline.blogspot.com</p><p>Back to the Future was the first film in the trilogy and was released on July 3, 1985. The plot followed Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back to the year 1955. He interferes in his parents meeting for the first time. He must then figure out a way to make his parents fall in love while trying to get back to the year 1985. When Marty goes back he ends up changing things in the future. Initially, his parents are in a loveless marriage but after Marty’s interference they become madly in love with each other. Another change that some fans might have missed is the name of the mall. Marty meets Doc at Twin Pines Mall for the time traveling experiment at the start of the film. Twin Pines Mall is named in tribute to Otis Peabody’s farm that had two distinctive pine trees on it. When Marty travels back to 1955 he ends up on Otis Peabody’s farm. Otis had dreams of raising pine trees but later his land was converted into a mall. When Marty lands on the farm he is chased away by Peabody and in the process runs over one of the pine trees. When Marty returns to 1985, he has changed the past and this is evident by the mall being&nbsp;named Lone Pine Mall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-clock-tower>14. The Clock Tower</h2><p>enduringbeta.com</p><p>The Clock Tower plays an important part in the Back to the Future trilogy and is seen in all three films. In the first film, it’s revealed that the clock tower was once struck by lighting and the city wants to tear down the clock tower. This information is valuable when Doc uses the lighting bolt to help Marty get back to 1985. However, some fans might not notice the subtle change caused by Doc Brown. Doc Brown is forced to climb up the clock tower to reconnect a cable necessary to send Marty back in time. While up there he breaks off a piece of the tower ledge where he’s standing. The damage caused by Doc is still seen on the tower when Marty returns to 1985. The Clock Tower is in the same condition in 2015 however, the Clock Tower has disappeared in the alternate 1985 timeline.

Marty and his band, The Pinheads, audition but are rejected by the judges. It’s a painful rejection for Marty but if fans look closely they’ll actually notice that one of the judges in Huey Lewis.

To celebrate that day several companies paid tribute to the film. Nike recreated the Nike Mag shoes that Marty wears in the future including the power laces. Toyota and Universal Pictures created the Toyota Tacoma that was inspired by the pickup truck that Marty drives in the trilogy. Universal Pictures released a fake trailer for Jaws 19, which is shown in the film.

However, at the last second one of the cables falls out and Doc climbs up the clock tower to reattach it. Doc almost falls off the tower but he hangs on. It’s one of the most iconic scenes in the film but was also paying homage to a classic film. Safety Last is a 1923 romantic silent film starring Harold Lloyd. The film is best remembered for the iconic scene of Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock tower over traffic. Safety Last is considered one of the best comedies of all time. However, even more fascinating is the fact that the climax in Back to the Future is hinted to at the very beginning of the film. The opening scene of the film is a shot of various clocks in Doc Brown’s lab.

Despite that they actually got a lot of stuff right about the future. One of the things they got wrong was the invention of flying cars. However, they were right about several things, such as flat screen TVs with multiple channels mounted on the wall, tablet computers, video-chat, hands-free video games, the rise of 3D films and the popularity of plastic surgery. Also, there was one more prediction they got right but they were just off by a year. The Chicago Cubs had never won a World Series since 1908, which many blamed on the Curse of the Billy Goat.

However, Back to the Future has always been considered his breakout role. He was offered the opportunity to reprise his role as George in the two sequels. However, Glover and the studio could not come to terms on a deal for the sequels. Glover claims that the studio wanted to pay him half of what Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson were getting paid. So the studio and Glover went their separate ways. Actor Jefferey Weissman, was cast in the role of George McFly and wore a fake chin, nose and cheekbones to better depict George. They also re-used footage of Crispin Glover from Back to the Future in Back to the Future Part II. However, they did so without his permission so Glover sued the producers of the film and won.

Originally, Doc Brown was going to have a pet chimpanzee but Sidney had it changed to a dog. He also had another suggestion that shocked and appalled the creators. Sidney wanted to change the title of the film to “Spaceman From Pluto”. Sidney was convinced that no film with “future” in the title could ever be successful and the film would bomb.

Initially, the power source is plutonium but is later changed to Mr. Fusion. However, the DeLorean wasn’t always the time machine. Originally, the time machine was just a laser in a room. In an early draft of the script the time machine was a refrigerator that had to be taken to an atomic bomb test site in order to time travel. However, Robert Zemeckis feared that children might lock themselves in a fridge after seeing the movie. It was changed to a DeLorean DMC-12 because it resembled an alien spacecraft, which was required so that those in 1955 would mistake it for an alien spacecraft.
